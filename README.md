# Fanuc-Karel-Robot
Program written to control a Fanuc Karel robotic arm written in BASIC.
This program uses a combination of routines and pre-set locations (JOINTPOS)
to control the function of a Fanuc Karel robotic arm working in a manufaturing setting.
This particular program controls pnuematics and positioning of the robotic to physically
pick up objects and move them to a new location. Program could be used in a factory setting 
to move objects from one production line to another conveyer line.
